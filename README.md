# DBMS_Assignmentmodule1Q: For a given Relation (Table) with given attributes and set of FDs, identify the keys and checkthe highest normal form it satisfies. If the highest NF is x then suggest appropriatedecomposition to take it to the (x+1) NF. Also identify the keys for the decomposed relations.USAGE:1.javac module12.java module13.<<Attributes seperated by sapce>>4.<<FD's with form A,B C,D>>module2Q:Simulation of Extendible hashing scheme.You can assume some initial GD , LD , hash-function and Bfr.Your program should take keys input through keyboard and display the hashing scheme onthe computer (preferably GUI). Display how the scheme evolves after each insertion, asdiscussed in the class.Support with Insertion and SearchingUSAGE:1.javac module2.java2.java module2 <<bucket_size>> (default=3)
